# Trees-with-leafs
 This Java project represents an implementation for generating and comparing trees, developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering
 
  Key Features:

Tree Generation: The program allows the generation of trees based on two crucial parameters - the crown height and the age of the tree. Users can specify these parameters, and the program will create and display a detailed tree structure in the console.

Top Tree Ranking: After generating multiple trees, the project provides functionality to create a top-ranking among them. The ranking criteria include the age of the tree and the number of leaves. The oldest tree with the most leaves secures the first position in the ranking.

User-Friendly Console Interface: The program uses a console interface that is user-friendly, facilitating interaction. Detailed information about trees and ranking results is displayed in an easily understandable manner.

Implemented OOP Concepts: The project highlights the implementation of fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Its modular structure encourages an efficient and extensible approach.
 
 example output:
 ```
 --------TOP BRAZI IN FUNCTIE DE FRUNZE SI VARSTA------- 
 1st PLACE --- Tree with 81 leaves and 70 years with a crown height of 9m.
          
                @ 
              # @ * 
            $ # # * $

                X
                X
                X
 ------------------------------------------------
 THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF 17 LEAVES BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND PLACE

2nd PLACE --- Tree with 64 leaves and 89 years  // number of leaves = 64  // crown height = 8
3rd PLACE --- Tree with 49 leaves and 81 years  // number of leaves = 49  // crown height = 7
4th PLACE --- Tree with 49 leaves and 18 years  // number of leaves = 49  // crown height = 7
5th PLACE --- Tree with 49 leaves and 3 years   // number of leaves = 49  // crown height = 7
6th PLACE --- Tree with 36 leaves and 72 years  // number of leaves = 36  // crown height = 6
